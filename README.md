## About Club22
### One thing that I spend a lot of my time doing (besides coding) is reading. My friends and I come together once a month for our Book Club, Club22.  Club22 is a MERN stack app I was inspired to design by our Book Club. While using Club22 a user is able to search books(using the Google Books API), like, or unlike the books and read some details such as page length, author, and a brief synopsis.

## Next steps:

### I would like for a user to be able to favorite and have a library of books they would want to read.
### I would like the user to be able to be suggested books based on those they have liked before. 
### I would like a user to be able to "friend" other users and be able to look through eachothers book libraries.
