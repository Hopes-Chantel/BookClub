## About Club22
### One thing that I spend a lot of my time doing (besides coding) is reading. My friends and I come together once a month for our Book Club, Club22.  Club22 is a MERN stack app I was inspired to design by our Book Club. While using Club22 a user is able to search books(using the Google Books API), like, or unlike the books and read some details such as page length, author, and a brief synopsis.
